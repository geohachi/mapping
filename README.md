# Satellite images for mapping

* Several sattelite images are available in mapping tools. (iD Editor, geom, etc.)
* Most mapping tasks instruct us to use Maxar image. 
* Bing is older!

# Difference of satellite images

See following two images of the same place. Fig.1 is Bing and Fig.2 is Maxar.
Can you find the difference between two?
Please disregard the color because it depends on the time and/or season the image was taken.

# Close-up

Please look at the following close-up picture of lower right (South-East) of the area.
Can you believe they are the same area?

New buidings and roads are easily found.
You may also notice that trees are larger in Maxar image than Bing. May be more than 5 years?

It depends on the area of-course, but you will find some differences in almost all area.
I often notice buidings have been rebuilt.

# How to switch satellite images
Now you understood the difference of satellite images.
I will show you how to switch them.
It depends on the editor you are using.
Here I will explain for iD Editor. (Figures here are from iD Editor.)

In iD editor, pressing **'B'** key brings up Background menu as shown in Fig.1.

In my case, the following list is shown.
* Bing aerial imagery
* Satellite and aerial imagery.
* Esri World Imagery
* Esri World Imagery (Clarity) Beta
* Mapbox Satellite
* Maxar Premium Imagery (Beta)
* Maxar Standard Imagery (Beta)

You can check those images.
Some are blur. Some may have cloud and you cannot see the ground.

As I mension already, Maxar image is so-so clear and the latest that is the most important thing for mapping.
So basically, you want to use Maxar image.
(I don't see any difference between "Maxar Premium Imagery" and "Maxar Standard Imagery", so I always use premium one.)
But in case you cannot see the building clearly in Maxar, you can tempolary switch background image to Bing or even another satellite to clarify the surface of the ground. (By using Ctrl-B, you can go back and forth the last two images.)

## Adjusting imagery offset
You may notice that there is imegery offset between two.
You can cancel it by using "adjust-imagery-offset" function in the menu if you want.
You need to scroll-down to reach this option. See Fig.5.

To adjust offset, drag gray area around the box by mouse cursor while the left button is pressed.
I recommend you adjust it only for Bing image if necessary, and keep 0,0 for Maxar.

## Adjusting image brightness/contrast
You can change image's brightness/contrast/etc. by adjusting "Display Option".
See Fig.6.
